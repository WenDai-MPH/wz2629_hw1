```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```


Problem 1:
This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types. 

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```



Problem 2:
This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.
